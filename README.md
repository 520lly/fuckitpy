#FuckItPy
### The Python Error Steamroller
FuckItPy uses state-of-the-art technology to make sure your Python code runs
whether it has any right to or not.

## Technology
Through a process known as *Exec-Rinse-And-Repeat*, FuckItPy repeatedly
compiles your code, detecting errors and slicing offending lines out of the script.

## API
**fuckit('your_shitty_module')**
Use this to replace an import that is raising exceptions on import. Just change
`import your_shitty_module` to `fuckit('your_shitty_module')`.

This will keep evaluating your code until all errors have been sliced off like
mold on a piece of perfectly good bread. Whether or not the remaining code is
even worth executing, we don't know. We also don't particularly care.
